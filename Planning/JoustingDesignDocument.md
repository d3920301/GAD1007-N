## Game Idea
My game is a jousting game, in which the player must knock down their opponent with a combination of knowledge and skill.

The game is split up into 3 parts:
- Jousting - This is the main part. You have to knock the opponent off their horse by playing the stardew valley fishing minigame.
- Investigating - You can walk aroud the arena and can hear murmers and hints about your next opponent.
- Planning - You have time to plan your equipment to get an advantage against your opponent.

## Player Control
While jousting, the player is moved by applying a force to it's rigidbody.

While investigating, the player is controlled by directly controlling its velocity.

While planning, the player is controlled by changing its transform.

## Microinteractions
